# Dota2ServerPingCheck
An application to check ping and packet-loss before launching the game.
 
Current Version: 1.1    

	Basically its a tool to check ping and packet-loss before even launching
the game. Many might think whats the need fo this tool as the game itself 
tells the ping. Well there are many reasons some of them are listed.

- Dota2 takes time to start even on an i7 Laptop it takes like 30 Seconds 
	minimum to start. Its very annoying that you take 30 seconds + time 
	then you see that your ping is not suitable for the game and you have
	to close it.
	
- Dota2 still doesn't tell about the packet-loss before the match starts.
	which means that if you start a Ranked game and there is packet-loss
	you can't do anything as you are already in the game either try playing
	or leave both will result in -25 MMR. This tool tells you about the 
	packet-loss if some server has one.
	
- There are many sorting options in the tool like sort by lowest ping, by 
	server name etc.
	
	Details on how to use the program are within the program. Download it 
open the binaries folder. You will find a compiled executable there Run it 
and enjoy. See Help menu for more details.

	Furthermore the code is written in C# .NET using Visual Studio.
If someone wants to Change the code to do something even better they can 
request a fork and commit there changes.
